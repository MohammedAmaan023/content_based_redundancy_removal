The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[3] It is also India's most viewed sports competition followed by the Pro Kabaddi League and Indian Super League, as per BARC.[4][5]

In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[13] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[14] In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[15] Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers.[16]

In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[17] meaning each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[18] As of 2024, there have been seventeen seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.
On 13 September 2007,[24] at the start of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the BCCI announced a franchise based Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[24][25]

To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for the eight franchises totalled $400 million,[23] but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million.[26] The league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[27]

Following the ban on players who chose to participate in the ICL, the rival league shut down in 2009
